# Docker for Data Science
This is my setup of data science docker. I will keep adding more packages as I need/learn more.  
If you run it as daemon then get the token from docker logs  
  
`master` does not contains anything   
Head to [pip](https://github.com/therahulprasad/docker-data-science/tree/pip), [Anaconda2](https://github.com/therahulprasad/docker-data-science/tree/Anaconda2) or [Anaconda3](https://github.com/therahulprasad/docker-data-science/tree/Anaconda3)
  
Run with $PWD as workdirectory and expose port 8888  
`docker run -v $PWD:/workdir -p 8888:8888 therahulprasad/data-science`
