# Docker for Data Science
This is my setup of data science docker. I will keep adding more packages as I need/learn more.  
If you run it as daemon then get the token from docker logs  
  
Run with $PWD as workdirectory and expose port 8888  
`docker run -v $PWD:/workdir -p 8888:8888 therahulprasad/data-science`
